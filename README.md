# Crowd-Density-Estimation-using-Video-Analytics-for-Smart-City-Monitoring
To simulate an IoT-based smart surveillance system that estimates crowd density from real-time recorded videos using computer vision and deep learning. Students will collect their own data, annotate it, and train an AI model for people detection and crowd counting.
